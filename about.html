                        <p class = "text">The acquisition of companies, intellectual property and talented individuals has been central to our growth strategy. In 2010, we acquired TSI and its subsidiaries in order to expand our B2B business, particularly our international air ticketing for small and medium scale enterprises. In 2012, we acquired Travelguru B2B and B2C entities from Travelocity, which remain well-established hotel aggregators in India. Through this acquisition, we expanded our hotel business by establishing more direct hotel relationships in India and improved our inventory of affordable travel options. Recently, we also acquired Air Travel Bureau Ltd. ("ATB"), India's largest independent corporate travel services provider to further strengthen our position in the growing corporate travel market in India. Now, with this combined entity, Yatra is the largest corporate travel services platform in India by Gross Bookings. We have also leveraged our leading position in the Indian travel ecosystem to make several "acqui-hires", including the teams from mGaadi and dudegenie, in order to grow our business.</p>
